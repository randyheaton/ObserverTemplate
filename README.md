# ObserverTemplate
An app starter template for my projectst that follow MVVM

# Summary

Pretty much every time I start working on a new app that uses a declarative, reactive framework like Compose, I recreate some version of this
Observer pattern where a central manager class dispatches updates to ViewModels. So I leaned into it and created a starter template with reminders for
how I generally use everything. 


What's a little different and slightly cool about this is that it adds a little more convenience wrapping so that ViewModels can be instantiated succinctly 
with a bunch of plumbing already baked in.
